# Installation tools

The scripts in this folder are run by pointing your browser at yoursite.com/install.php

The system will attempt to walk you through the steps of configuring and initializing your site. Depending on your server configuration it may even be able to do some of the work for you.

Once you have finished installation it is advisable to delete both this directory and `web/install.php`.
